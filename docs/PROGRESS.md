**Done**
- Analysed the Google Sheets budget (Yulia 2026, Vlad 2026) and derived the default categories and the report layout.
- Agreed on the stack: ASP.NET Core (.NET 10) + React/TypeScript + Mantine, PostgreSQL on Neon, hosting on Render,
  GitHub Actions CI, Identity with Google sign-in, NBU exchange rates, Playwright for UI tests, Storybook.
- Created the repository with planning documents and ADRs 0001–0006 (T-001).
- Installed the GitHub CLI.

**Decisions**
- Integration tests and email (Resend) moved to after the MVP; Google sign-in is in the MVP.
- Categories are personal; removing default categories and private data are after the MVP.
- One family per person. UI in English; Ukrainian later. Recurring transactions are out of scope.

**Next**
- T-002: create the private GitHub repo and push (needs `gh auth login` by the user).
- Answer open questions Q-001…Q-004.
- T-003 / T-004: scaffold backend and frontend.
